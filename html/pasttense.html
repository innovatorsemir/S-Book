                    <p><span class="color">&rArr;</span> We use the past perfect tense:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>for something that started in the past and continued up to a given time in the past:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><span class="color">E.g:</span> When George died he and Anne <strong>had been married </strong>for nearly fifty years.<br>
                        <span class="color">&rarr;</span> She didn’t want to move. She <strong>had lived </strong>in Liverpool all her life.</p>
                    <p><strong><span class="color">Note:</span></strong> We normally use the past perfect <strong>continuous </strong>for this:</p>
                    <p><span class="color">&rarr;</span> She didn’t want to move. She <strong>had been living </strong>in Liverpool all her life.<br>
                        <span class="color">&rarr;</span> Everything was wet. It <strong>had been raining </strong>for hours.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> for something we had done <strong>several times </strong>up to a point in the past and
                            <strong>continued </strong>to do <strong>after that point</strong>:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><span class="color">E.g:</span> He was a wonderful guitarist. He <strong>had been playing </strong>ever since he was a teenager.<br>
                        <span class="color">&rarr;</span> He <strong>had written three </strong>books and he was working on another one.<br>
                        <span class="color">&rarr;</span> I <strong>had been watching </strong>the programme every week, but I missed the last episode.</p>
                    <p><span class="color">&rArr;</span> We often use a clause with <em><strong>since </strong></em>to show when something started in the past:
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="color">E.g:</span> They had been staying with us <strong>since </strong><u>the previous week</u>.<br>
                        <span class="color">&rarr;</span> I was sorry when the factory closed. I had worked there <strong>since </strong><u>I left school</u>.<br>
                        <span class="color">&rarr;</span> I had been watching that programme every week <strong>since</strong> <u>it started</u>, but I missed the last episode.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> when we are <strong>reporting our experience</strong> and including up to the (then) present:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><span class="color">E.g:</span> My eighteenth birthday was the worst day I had ever had.<br>
                        <span class="color">&rarr;</span> I was pleased to meet George. I hadn’t met him before, even though I had met his wife several times.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> for something that happened in the <strong>past</strong> but is <strong>important at the time of reporting</strong>:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><span class="color">E.g:</span> I couldn’t get into the house.<strong> I had lost </strong>my keys.<br>
                        <span class="color">&rarr;</span> Teresa wasn’t at home. <strong>She had gone </strong>shopping.</p>
                    <p><span class="color">&rArr;</span> We use the past perfect to talk about the past in <strong>conditions</strong>, <strong>hypotheses
                        </strong>and <strong>wishes</strong>:</p>
                    <p><span class="color">E.g:</span> I would have helped him <u>if</u> <strong>he had asked</strong>.<br>
                        <span class="color">&rarr;</span> It was very dangerous. <u>What if</u> <strong>you had got</strong> lost?<br>
